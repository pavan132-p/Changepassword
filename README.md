# Changepassword
Project Description: TutorialsNinja - Change Password Automation
In this project, I created an automated Cypress script to validate and automate the user journey for changing an account password on the TutorialsNinja demo e-commerce website. This automation aims to improve the efficiency of repetitive testing tasks by scripting the end-to-end flow from login, product search, and checkout to updating the user password. The automation also incorporates robust validation checks to ensure accuracy at every stage.

Project Objectives
The goal was to develop a Cypress automation script to streamline the testing of the password-change feature on the TutorialsNinja website (https://tutorialsninja.com/demo/). This involved navigating through multiple stages of the user journey, from product search to order confirmation, culminating in changing the user password. The objective was to ensure that each step functioned seamlessly, enhancing both testing speed and reliability.

Tools and Technologies Used

Programming Language: JavaScript
Automation Tool: Cypress
Browser: Chrome (or Electron by default)
IDE: Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Outcome
This project provided a thorough understanding of Cypress automation, POM implementation, and key best practices for e-commerce website testing. The scripted automation of the change password feature on TutorialsNinja demonstrates an efficient, reliable approach to testing that reduces manual effort and supports continuous quality assurance.
